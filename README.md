## Description
Welcome to venYou! Are you a fan of live music, but are not sure who to see? Sure you may have your music taste already figured out, but the next concert from your favorite band isn't until next year! How can I find music I love while still singing and dancing or stage-diving with a crowd of people around me?

The purpose of venYou is to give concert lovers the power to discover new artists like the ones they already love! choose from a list of similar artists that compare to the ones you already know, and find their next closest show to see what they're all about!


## Installation

## Usage
 the user can input into the text box a band that they like or already know, then click to discover artists that fit the same genre, from that list of similar artists the user can select any one to learn more about them. in addition, the user can elect to enter location information, and the app will compare that to tour dates and concert schedules of the new artist they're interested in. find your next closest show with venYou!
