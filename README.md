## Description

Welcome to menYou! the personalized date creator! menYou was created for those who are looking for new and fun date ideas, but just aren't sure what they want to do. For users, menYou takes the classic dinner and movie date and creates the date for you! Making date night something new and interesting every time you try it.

The purpose of menYou is to give the user ideas and suggestions for how to create their dinner and movie date, taking the hassle out of planning and coming up with something on your own every time.

## Installation

This project runs as a web application which can be accessed through any standard web browser.

## Usage

The user is presented with 3 input fields that they can select options for type of food and drink they want to have, as well as movie suggestions. The user selects from a dropdown of options that tell the application the category of food, drink, and movie the user might be interested in. The application takes that information and creates a curated menu and movie suggestion for the user, and displays that information on the page with recipe links.

## Future Updates

As this application develops, we hope to add functionality for the user to select movie ratings based on RottenTomatoes ratings. Furthermore, we would like to add a wider array of food and drink menu items, which interact with each other to produce more curated and specified results to the user. the current APi parameters restrict the ability to add these clarifications and would require financial investment to do so. In later updates, we hope to expand the functionality to not only produce dinner and movie dates, but to include other locations the user can visit within their local area to plan a much wider variety of date ideas, like restaurant location and movie theater show times.
